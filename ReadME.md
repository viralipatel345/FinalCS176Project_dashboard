Welcome to the Amazon Co-Purchasing Network Analysis Project! Our project analyzes the Top 5000 Communities of Amazon's Co-Purchasing Network, which is from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Amazon.html). In this project, we ran several experiments in order to understand community and clustering patterns formed by the "frequently bought together" feature on Amazon. These experiments include finding different centralities, and running 4 community-detection algorithms -- girvan-newman, louvain, lemon, and k-clique. 

In this repository, the raw source code for our experiments can be found in the AnusriChavali_ViraliPatel_FinalCS176Project.ipynb file. The visualizations produced by the code can be found in the FinalCS176Project_dashboard_clean.html file. The dataset is linked in the github as com-amazon.top5000.cmty.txt.gz.
